During the creation of this, the key thing was the challenges faced which were primarly the interactive
component

Key Components
HTML, Style.Css, and making javascript code more interactive for users

challenges
-progress bar (setting up the tracking)
-messing up any code with smidge errors with leads to the whole thing to not function properly
^^ruining the results and workrate 
-The overall interactive component is what troubled me the most along with the javascript code as 
a mistake can lead to havoc and going thorugh the code to fix it (time consuming and hard to find errors)
